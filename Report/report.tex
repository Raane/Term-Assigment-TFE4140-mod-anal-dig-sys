\begin{abstract}
    \todo{ Compulsory (means that it is specified in the Term Project in description of report set up, and at this very location). Create a fitting abstract here. Also create a FRONT PAGE. Yes, you didn't read wrong. I wrote in capital letters. If we miss this now, we must indeed be quite stupid...}
\end{abstract}

\section{Front Page}
\todo{ Compulsory. Again, create FRONT PAGE. Didn't immediatly know better how to put this in, so just added this as first section (NOOB!). }

\section{Introduction}
\todo{ Compulsory. Introduction that explains what to expect of the report. Introduction of the term project should be covered in abstract? }

\section{Table of Contents}
\todo{ Compulsory. Must generate. I leave that to you, Rune}

\section{Problem to be solved. Method.}

\subsection{Introduction}
This chapter will introduce the reader to the details of the problem that is to be solved through this Term Assignment. First the NTNU Student Satellite and the use need for a fault tolerant communication module will be described, then the Framework for the project will be detailed.

\subsection{The Liasion Fault Tolerant System}
NTNU is working with a Student Satellite, which is to orbit Earth and measure atmospheric data and deliver this to a ground stattion. The goal of this Assignment is to design a fault tolerant system called Liasion, which exploits redundancy. The system will contain four independent microcontrollers, that perform the same calculations. Every computation will procude 8-bit words. There is always the chance due to cosmic radiation that one more microcontrollers may produce incorrect data. If this is the case, the majority will decide the correct data, in a process known as \textit{voting}. The voted data is to be accompanied by a 3-bit status signal which contains the number of failed microcontrollers. If too many microcontrollers have failed, this status signal will indicate it so that recieved data cannot be trusted. Additionally, data may be corrupted before reaching Earth. This problem is to be solved by implementing a module with Error Correcting Circuit (ECC) that uses Hamming Code. The chosen solution must be able to correct single-bit errors and detect double-bit errors.

\subsection{The Liasion Module functionality in details}
kkk

\subsection{Project Framework}
The system is to be encoded in VHDL, tested and verified in simulation, and synthesized, with a goal of having a few Look Up Tables (LUTs) as possible. \todo{ Perhaps briefly explain what a LUT is?}
Active HDL \todo{ Version number?} is used for programming in VHDL, as well as creating test benches and running simulations for verification. Synplify Pro \todo{ Version number?} is used for synthesizing, creating resulting LUTs and estimated frequency, and creating RTL schematics and Gate-Level \todo{ Find correct name} schematics. 
\break 
\todo{ Replace break with new paragraph in such a way that \textit{a)}, \textit{b)}, \textit{c)}, ... is not added}
\break
\todo{ Yes, new paragraph here} The Term Assignment was handed out at \todo{ Insert date here, somewhere in January}. These are the milestones: \todo{ Again, need reference from the Term Assignment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item February 18th, 2014: Assignment 3 of the Course, where the individual One-Bit Voters are designed. They serve as basis of the 8-bit voters
    \item February 28th, 2014: Delivery of technical notes, that will contain preliminary solutions to sub-problems 1, 2 and 3.
    \item March 3rd, 2014: Delivery of Peer Evaluation, containing evaluation of the technical note and project of another group.
    \item March 31st, 2014: Presentation of the project for groups 1-9 (minus 7).
    \item April 3rd, 2014: Presentation of the project for groups 7, 10-19.
    \item April 4th, 2014: Final report delivery.
\end{itemize}
